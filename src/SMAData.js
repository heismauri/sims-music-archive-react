                Before Mark Mothersbaugh took over, Jerry was tasked with producing a set of tracks in a <strong>style
                reminiscent of his earlier work</strong> for The Sims. It is speculated that these tracks were employed
                in builds of The Sims 2 as recent as <strong>October 2003</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                These compositions were initially accessible on Jerry's website, Jerry Martin Music, but have since
                become inaccessible <strong>unless the correct URL is known</strong>. Due to the dedicated efforts of
                our team, there is now no need for any guesswork!
              </p>
              <p>
                The objective of this album is to compile all these previously unused tracks into a single release for
                your listening enjoyment. Each track has been <strong>appropriately tagged and adorned with custom
                artwork</strong> for your pleasure.
